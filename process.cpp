//  Run a Process for some time
//  The process would like to complete its current CPU burst,
//  but is currently only allowed what is granted to it.
//  Parameters:
//      clock           (modified int)  time on simulation clock
//      allowance       (input int)     time allowed to run with
//      next            (output Device) what device should be used next
//		next is from { disk, net, console, cpu )
//  Post-Condition:
//      the clock will have advanced until either the allowed time
//      has been used up, or the current CPU burst is complete
//      (whichever happens earlier).  There will be no idle CPU time.
//  Also:  The history log for this Process will record what is known
//      at this time
